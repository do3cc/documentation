Connected Building is a cloud based collection of services to implement use-cases for commercial buildings. The diagram below gives a overview of the solution architecture landscape and the services.

![Connected Building Overview](assets/connectedbuilding_overview.png)

### Credentials

If you want to use the Connected Building REST API or the cockpit you require:

 - [Bosch ID](https://myaccount.bosch.com/BeaPUssWeb/registration)
 - Invitation connected building services.

For the invitation to the connected building services please send a message to slack channel: `#cb-invitation`.

### Credentials Data ingest

To send data to the connected building a `system-id` and `token` is required. Ask the connected building for your credentials.

### Connected Building Dashboard

BCX19 Dashboard: <https://eu.bosch-connectedbuilding.com/dashboard/auth/login?tenant=cb_bcx_2019>

### Connected Building APIs

The APIs are based on common REST concepts. Authentication oAuth 2.0 `Client Credentials Grant Type` and `Authorization Code Grant Type` are supported to get a access token for the API.

REST API | Description | Swagger
-- | -- | --
**External System Connector** | API to ingest data from external building systems. Data is ingested as events (create and update event body based on [Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/doc/Json) JSON) . | [docs](https://eu.bosch-connectedbuilding.com/documentation/swagger/swagger-ui.html?urls.primaryName=system-connector-app)
**Equipment State** | API to query the actual state of the equipment and the building equipment | [docs](https://eu.bosch-connectedbuilding.com/documentation/swagger/swagger-ui.html?urls.primaryName=state-app)
**Dashboard Management** | API to mange the resources for the dashboard (cockpit) e.g. heat-map or simple times series data. | [docs](https://eu.bosch-connectedbuilding.com/documentation/swagger/swagger-ui.html?urls.primaryName=dashboard-app)
